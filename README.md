# webcam-motion-detector-using-python
Using python and many of it's library I have created "Webcam motion detector".

It uses pandas, Opencv2 (which is a library used for image or video capturing and processing) , datetime.

Using pandas I have created csv file which will show the exact time of object entering the frame and leaving the frame .
